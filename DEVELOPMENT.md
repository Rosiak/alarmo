## üì¶ Requirements

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- Python 3.x (Latest stable version recommended)
- Git (Latest version)
- Visual Studio Code (Recommended editor)
- Terminal/Command Prompt access

## üß™ Setting Up the Development Environment with `uv`

We use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a modern Python package manager that's significantly faster than pip and provides better dependency resolution.

### üîß Installation (one-time setup)

1. First, install `uv` by following the [official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. Fork the repository:
   - Visit https://github.com/nielsfaber/alarmo
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right
   - Wait for GitHub to create your fork

3. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/alarmo.git
   cd alarmo
   ```

### üì¶ Setup Python Environment

Running the following commands will:
- Create a new virtual environment in `.venv`
- Install all project dependencies from `uv.lock`
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

```bash
# Install dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Update VSCode Settings

To ensure VSCode uses the correct Python environment:

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P)
2. Type and select `Python: Select Interpreter`
3. Choose the interpreter at `./.venv/bin/python`

This will configure debugging, linting, and other Python features to use your project's environment.

### Running Scripts

One of the benefits of `uv` is that you don't need to manually activate the virtual environment. Here are some common commands:

```bash
# Run a Python script
uv run python ./script.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests

# Add a new dependency
uv add package_name

# Update dependencies
uv sync --upgrade
```

### Testing Your Changes

Testing is crucial for maintaining code quality. Before submitting changes:

1. Pre-commit hooks will automatically run tests when you commit
2. Review the [Test Documentation](./tests/README.md) for writing new tests

### Managing Python Versions

Alarmo uses a file to manage Python versions:

- `pyproject.toml`: Defines the compatible Python versions for the project

When updating Python versions:
1. Update `pyproject.toml` with your target version
2. Test thoroughly with the new version

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Bypassing pre-commit hooks

While we recommend fixing issues identified by pre-commit, there may be situations where you need to bypass the hooks temporarily:
- During emergency hotfixes
- When committing work-in-progress changes
- When making documentation-only changes

You can bypass pre-commit hooks for a single commit using either:
```bash
# Long form
git commit -m "your message" --no-verify

# Short form
git commit -m "your message" -n
```

**Important:** After bypassing hooks:
1. This should be used sparingly
2. Run checks manually before pushing:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
3. Document the reason for bypassing in your commit message
